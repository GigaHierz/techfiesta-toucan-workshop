# Retiring Carbon Credits on Celo using Toucan SDK :deciduous_tree:

Retire Carbon Credits on Celo using ToucanSDK :seedling:

Learn how to make your dApp climate positive with a few lines of¬†code. :woman_technologist:

Climate change is real, and thinking of our carbon footprint when building software should be part of the planning process as much as thinking about the architecture. One blockchain that is leading in this regard is Celo blockchain. They are even offsetting more carbon than they are producing. So, if your choice of network for your application is [Celo](https://celo.org/), you already made a step in the right direction. But other actions can increase your or your users carbon footprint and, in this tutorial, you will learn how to account for that in a few lines of code and create a climate positive app. If you are new to carbon credit retirements and what kind of infrastructure tools Toucan provides, make sure to read up on it in their [blog](https://blog.toucan.earth).

### Prerequisites:

To start building, you'll need a basic understanding of web development, Node (v12), yarn, and Git.

- Node
- Yarn
- Git

### Tools we will use:

- [Celo-Composer](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-composer)
- [Toucan SDK](https://github.com/ToucanProtocol/toucan-sdk)

Okay. What will we learn in this tutorial in detail? We will learn how to retire carbon credits on Celo. To do that we will have to first acquire some carbon pool token from a DEX, redeem these e.g, Nature Carbon Tonnes (NCTs) for tokenized carbon credits (TCO2s) and retire those. We will also learn how to get all data related to tokens and retirements through querying the [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/toucanprotocol/alfajores). As a little cherry on the top, we will do a quick preview of the OffsetHelper that will simplify all of this even more!!

By the end of this tutorial, you will know

- how to redeem carbon reference tokens, like NCT for TCO2
- how to retire TCO2
- how to query the subgraph to get details on tokens, retirements and certificates

**_And now lets start building üèó_**

---

## Quickstart your project

Clone this repository and open the project in our favorite IDE (e.g., VS Code).

```
git clone git@github.com:GigaHierz/co-operate-workshop.git
```

First navigate into the react-app.

```
cd packages/react-app/
```

Here install all dependencies with

```
npm i
```

or

```
yarn
```

And finally, let's start the App and see if everything is running.

```
npm run dev
```

or

```
yarn run dev
```

---

## Set the Environment Variables

In out `packages/react-app` we will create an `.env` file.

```
mkdir .env
```

With the newest update, every dApp that relies on WalletConnect now needs to obtain a projectId from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in). This is absolutely free and only takes a few minutes.

Provide the projectId to getDefaultWallets and individual RainbowKit wallet connectors like the following:

Add you token ID as vaule for `NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID` to the `.env` file.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID=289a40b4eef16151e....
```

## Retire Carbon¬†Credits

Next, we are going to retire carbon credits on Celo using the Toucan SDK. The Toucan SDK provides you with tools to simply implement carbon retirements into your app with just a few lines of code. It also provides some pre-defined subgraph queries but offers you the freedom to create any query your heart desires to get all the info about all retirements and tokens.

---

## Install the SDK

Add the Toucan SDK.

```
npm i toucan-sdk
```

or

```
yarn add toucan-sdk
```

### Get Toucan Client

We want to first instantiate the ToucanClient and set a signer & provider to interact with our infrastructure. If you are running a version lower than 1.0. you can use the signer & provider from the wagmi library. Otherwise use the [Ethers.js Adapters](https://wagmi.sh/react/ethers-adapters), as the Toucan SDK is not yet updated to viem and the `usePublicClient` won't work.
For interacting with The Graph, no provider or signer is needed.

So in the `index.ts` file we will add the imports to the top:

```typescript
import ToucanClient from "toucan-sdk";
import { useEthersProvider, useEthersSigner } from "../utils/ethers";
```

In case it shows an error message with `Module not found: Can't resolve 'toucan-sdk'`, just delete the node_moudles and run `yarn`or `npm  i` again.

And the following part goes into our function body. You can set the signer and provider directly or at a later point. Here we want to first check if the signer is set, meaning if the user is connected to the application with their wallet.

```typescript
const provider = useEthersProvider();
const signer = useEthersSigner();

const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores", provider);
signer && toucan.setSigner(signer);
```

In the end our code should look like this:

```typescript
import ToucanClient from "toucan-sdk";
import { useEthersProvider, useEthersSigner } from "../utils/ethers";

export default function Home() {
  const provider = useEthersProvider();
  const signer = useEthersSigner();

  const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores", provider);
  signer && toucan.setSigner(signer);

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="h1">
        There you go... a canvas for your next techfiesta project!
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Redeem Tokens form a PoolContract (e.g. NCT)

To retire Carbon Credits, we need pool tokens (e.g., NCTs) or carbon reference tokens like TCO2s. We can get them from the [Toucan Faucet](https://faucet.toucan.earth/). In this example we will get NCT, as theses are the tokens, you can buy in an exchange like [Ubeswap](https://ubeswap.org/).

What is the difference between NCTs and TCO2s? Simply put, TCO2s are tokenized carbon credits. While NCT are the first carbon reference tokens created on Toucans infrastructure and are stripped of most attributes. As a user you will only have TCO2 tokens, if you tokenized carbon credits yourself or if you have already redeemed NCTs for TCO2s. So, this example will start with NCTs.

üçÉ Get some Nature Carbon Tonnes (NCT) form the Toucan Faucet before you continue. Make sure you have CELO to pay the gas fee for the withdrawal, you can get some from the [Celo Faucet](https://faucet.celo.org/alfajores). üçÉ

Now, using the ToucanSDK we will auto-redeem the Pool tokens with `toucan.redeemAuto2`, where they are exchanged for the lowest ranking TCO2s. The function also returns the addresses of the redeemed TCO2s, which we need for the next step. As arguments for the function, we will need the pool symbol, that we want to retire, like "NCT". We will also need to input the amount of tokens we wish to retire, use `parseEther("1")` from the "ethers.js" for that.

If we prefer to choose the TCO2s that we want to retire, we can get a list of all TCO2s with `getScoredTCO2s` and then select the ones we prefer. Currently scored TCO2 means, that the tokens are sorted by year with `scoredTokens[0]` being the lowest. Using the Toucan SDK, you can get more info on each of the tokens though querying the subgraph (as described in the next part), and decide your own criteria, based on the newly released Core Carbon Principals. When choosing the TCO2 you want to retire, make sure that the balance of the token is not 0.

After having chosen TCO2s we want to retire, (we can choose several) we can redeem them with toucan.redeemMany. For this Toucan Protocol takes fees. We can calculate the fee beforehand with toucan.`toucan.calculateRedeemFees`.

But today we stay simple with `toucan.redeemAuto2`.

```typescript
await toucan.redeemAuto2("NCT", parseEther("1"));
```

Now let's put that code in a function and add a button to trigger it, so we can see it in action!! We also want to store the return value, the TCO2 address in a variable, as we will want to use it in the next step.

```typescript
import ToucanClient from "toucan-sdk";
import { useEthersProvider, useEthersSigner } from "../utils/ethers";
import { parseEther } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const provider = useEthersProvider();
  const signer = useEthersSigner();

  const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores", provider);
  signer && toucan.setSigner(signer);

  // we will store our return value here
  const [tco2address, setTco2address] = useState("");

  const redeemPoolToken = async (): Promise<void> => {
    const redeemedTokenAddress = await toucan.redeemAuto2(
      "NCT",
      parseEther("1")
    );
    redeemedTokenAddress && setTco2address(redeemedTokenAddress[0].address);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        className="inline-flex w-full justify-center rounded-full border px-5 my-5 py-2 text-md font-medium border-wood bg-prosperity text-black hover:bg-snow"
        onClick={() => redeemPoolToken()}
      >
        {"Redeem Tokens"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Okayyyy, let's connect our wallet Wallet Connect button and redeem the token. And üëì Check the transaction on [Celoscan](https://alfajores.celoscan.io) üëì

---

### Retire TCO2s

After having redeemed our pool tokens for TCO2s, we will be able to retire them. We can only retire TCO2 tokens. We can either choose to simply toucan.retire or if we would like to retire for a third party use the toucan.retireFrom function. Lastly, we can also already get a certificate created with `toucan.retireAndMintCertificate`.

The first thing we will have to do, will be to get the address of our TCO2 token. We will have saved that as return value form toucan.redeemAuto2. And now we can retire our token.

```typescript
await toucan.retire(parseEther("1.0"), tco2Address);
```

Let's create a second function called retirePoolToken as well as a button for the retirement process.

```typescript
import ToucanClient from "toucan-sdk";
import { useEthersProvider, useEthersSigner } from "../utils/ethers";
import { parseEther } from "ethers/lib/utils";
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Home() {
  const provider = useEthersProvider();
  const signer = useEthersSigner();
  const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores", provider);
  signer && toucan.setSigner(signer);
  const [tco2address, setTco2address] = useState("");

  const redeemPoolToken = async (): Promise<void> => {
    const redeemedTokenAddress = await toucan.redeemAuto2(
      "NCT",
      parseEther("1")
    );
    redeemedTokenAddress && setTco2address(redeemedTokenAddress[0].address);
  };

  const retire = async (): Promise<void> => {
    await toucan.retire(parseEther("1.0"), tco2address);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        className="inline-flex w-full justify-center rounded-full border px-5 my-5 py-2 text-md font-medium border-wood bg-prosperity text-black hover:bg-snow"
        onClick={() => redeemPoolToken()}
      >
        {"Redeem Tokens"}
      </button>
      <button
        className="inline-flex w-full justify-center rounded-full border px-5 my-5 py-2 text-md font-medium border-wood bg-prosperity text-black hover:bg-snow"
        onClick={() => retire()}
      >
        {"Retire Tokens"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You now have the foundation to implement retirement with endless possibilities like in one function and trigger retirements based on an input.

## Creating a list of our retirements

In the last step, we are creating a list showing our retirements. First, we will create a new `list.tsx` page.

Here we need the Toucan Client again. This time, we won't need a provider or signer as we are only querying the [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/toucanprotocol/alfajores).

```typescript
const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores");
```

The Toucan SDK has several pre-defined queries to get data from the subgraph, but we can also create our customized query with `toucan.fetchCustomQuery()`. We can check all schemes, create and test our query in the playground of the [Toucan Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/toucanprotocol/alfajores).

For now, we will use one of the predefined queries, to get a list of our retirements. We will need the user address here so we will use the useAccount Hook from wagmi. Remember that an address (user, token) always needs to be lower case for querying.

```typescript
const { address } = useAccount();

await toucan.fetchUserRetirements(address?.toLowerCase());
```

Now let's add save the return value in a state, add typing for our retirement data, fetch the user retirements when the component is loading and add some code to display our retirements in a table.

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import ToucanClient, { UserRetirementsResponse } from "toucan-sdk";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";

export default function List() {
  const { address } = useAccount();
  const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores");

  const [retirements, setRetirements] = useState<UserRetirementsResponse[]>([]);

  const fetchRetirements = async (address: string) => {
    const result = await toucan.fetchUserRetirements(address?.toLowerCase());
    result && setRetirements(result);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    address && fetchRetirements(address);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="mt-8 flow-root">
        <div className="-mx-4 -my-2 overflow-x-auto sm:-mx-6 lg:-mx-8">

            {retirements?.length && (

                    </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody className="divide-y divide-black bg-white">
                    {retirements.map((item) => {

                        </tr>
                      );
                    })}
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </div>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Add the list page into the header.tsx file as "Retirements" and you are done!

## Offsetting with the OffsetHelper

So far the OffsetHelper has only been deployed on Polygon. But now it's almost ready on Celo.
This contract will make it even easier to retire carbon credits.

What does it do in detail:

- user exchanges cUSD for NCT tokens at one of the DEXs (Ubeswap, Uniswap soon)
- user interacts with the NCT token contract to redeem the tokens for TCO2
- user interacts with the TCO2 token contract to retire the TCO2

very cool!! lets try it out!!!

first let's create a new page called `AutoOffset.tsx`. Let's use the `usePrepareContractWrite` and `useContractWrite` from the wagmi library to call the `autoOffsetPoolToken` function.
You will need to look up the address of the poolToken you want to retire/offset. You can find all addresses of Toucans [deployed contracts](https://toucan.earth/contracts) on their page.
The token should already be in your wallet. If you need some for testing, head over to our [Faucet](https://faucet.toucan.earth/). Otherwise head over to Ubeswap (soon Uniswap) to buy some. There are other functions in the OffsetHelper, that already overtake the swapping part. So, check it out.

We will do the Offsetting directly on Celo (not using the testnet).

```typescript
autoOffsetPoolToken(poolToken: string, amount: BigNumber);
```

```typescript
import { parseEther } from "ethers/lib/utils.js";
import { useContractWrite, usePrepareContractWrite } from "wagmi";

export default function autoOffset() {
  const poolAddress = "0x02De4766C272abc10Bc88c220D214A26960a7e92";
  const amount = parseEther("1");

  const { config } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    address: "0xAB62E8a5A43453339f745EaFcbEE0302A31c3d5E",
    abi: [
      {
        inputs: [
          {
            internalType: "address",
            name: "_poolToken",
            type: "address",
          },
          {
            internalType: "uint256",
            name: "_amountToOffset",
            type: "uint256",
          },
        ],
        outputs: [
          {
            internalType: "address[]",
            name: "tco2s",
            type: "address[]",
          },
          {
            internalType: "uint256[]",
            name: "amounts",
            type: "uint256[]",
          },
        ],
        name: "autoOffsetPoolToken",
        stateMutability: "nonpayable",
        type: "function",
      },
    ],
    functionName: "autoOffsetPoolToken",
    args: [poolAddress, amount],
    gas: BigInt(2500000),
    value: BigInt(0),
  });

  const { data, isLoading, isSuccess, write } = useContractWrite(config);

  return <div></div>;
}
```

okay. you might get an error. and for a reason. First we will have the user approve the amount that the OffsetHelper will retire. Here the Toucan SDK comes in handy again. We can get the pool contract by just looking for the symbol like "NCT".

```typescript
import ToucanClient from "toucan-sdk";
import { useEthersProvider, useEthersSigner } from "@/utils/ethers";

const provider = useProvider();
const { data: signer, isError } = useSigner();
const toucan = new ToucanClient("celo", provider);
signer && toucan.setSigner(signer);

const poolToken = toucan.getPoolContract("NCT");
const offsetHelperAddress = "0xAB62E8a5A43453339f745EaFcbEE0302A31c3d5E";

const approve = async () => {
  return await poolToken.approve(offsetHelperAddress, amount);
};
```

Let's call the function and add a button.

```typescript
const offset = async () => {
  const tx = await approve();
  await tx.wait();

  write && write();
};

return (
  <div>
    <button
      className="inline-flex w-full justify-center rounded-full border px-5 my-5 py-2 text-md font-medium border-wood bg-prosperity text-black hover:bg-snow"
      onClick={() => offset?.()}
    >
      offset
    </button>
    {isLoading && <div>Check Wallet</div>}
    {isSuccess && (
      <div>
        <a
          href={`https://celoscan.io/tx/${JSON.stringify(data.hash)}`}
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          {" "}
          Transaction: {JSON.stringify(data.hash)}
        </a>{" "}
      </div>
    )}{" "}
  </div>
);
```

If you followed the guide your code should now look like this:

```typescript
export default function AutoOffset() {
  const poolAddress = "0x02De4766C272abc10Bc88c220D214A26960a7e92";
  const amount = parseEther("1");
  const provider = useEthersProvider();
  const signer = useEthersSigner();

  const toucan = new ToucanClient("alfajores", provider, signer);

  const poolToken = toucan.getPoolContract("NCT");
  const offsetHelperAddress = "0x065C0f397ecb9D904aB65242F41B9484AA9cD9Bf";

  const approve = async () => {
    return await poolToken.approve(offsetHelperAddress, amount);
  };

  const { config } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    address: offsetHelperAddress,
    abi: [
      {
        inputs: [
          {
            internalType: "address",
